# Project 4: Walkability & Air Quality in Los Angeles

### Problem Statement:
This is a regression problem that predicts whether the walkability of a geographic region correlates with air quality. Our goal with this analysis is to determine if areas of high walkability are areas with good air quality.
Looking at the U.S. EPA Walkability Index which highlights the walkability of  a region (using census data from 2017-2019), and EPA data from 2018 for Air Quality Index (AQI), will regions (CBSAs) with high walkability have good air quality?     Our stakeholders are families who want to move to an area of high walkability
