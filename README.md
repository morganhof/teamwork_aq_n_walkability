# Project 4: Walkability & Air Quality in Los Angeles

### Problem Statement:
This is a regression problem that predicts whether the walkability of the Los Angeles area correlates with air quality. The goal of this analysis is to determine if areas of high walkability are also areas with good air quality -- particularly within the Los Angeles whose walkability and air quality can vary depending on accessibility to public transit, forrest fires, and proximity to the Ocean.
Looking at the U.S. EPA Walkability Index which highlights the walkability of a region (using census data from 2017-2019), and EPA data from 2018 for Air Quality Index (AQI), will regions (CBSAs) with high walkability have good air quality?     Our stakeholders are families who want to move to an area of high walkability
