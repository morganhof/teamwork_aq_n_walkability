# Project 4: Walkability & Air Quality in Los Angeles

### Problem Statement:
This is a regression problem that predicts whether the walkability of the Los Angeles area correlates with air quality. The goal of this analysis is to determine if areas of high walkability are also areas with good air quality -- particularly within the Los Angeles whose walkability and air quality can vary depending on accessibility to public transit, forrest fires, and proximity to the Ocean.
Looking at the [U.S. EPA Walkability Index](https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B251AFDD9-23A7-4068-9B27-A3048A7E6012%7D) which highlights the walkability of a region (using census data from 2017-2019) and the [U.S. EPA Air Quality Index (AQI)](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html), we are hoping to determine if regions (CBSAs & CSAs) with high walkability also have good air quality.     

Our stakeholders are families who want to move to Los Angeles in an area of both good walkability and good air quality.

### Executive Summary:

### Data Sources:
##### Air Quality:
The air quality data comes from the EPA and is available at (https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html). 
We used annual summary data on the level of concentration by monitor from 2018.
Using the monitor readings is the most granular data available.
Data through 2021 was also available at the time of this project, but we used 2018 data for two reasons.
First, the walkability index is published on a lag so that the most recent index uses raw data primarily from 2017 and 2018.
Second, using 2018 data avoids unusual patterns in the data due to COVID-19.

##### Walkability:
The walkability data is also published by the EPA and can be downloaded at (https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping).
This data includes metrics in five primary categories - density, diversity, design, transit accessiblity, and destination asseccibility - and combines them in an overall walkability index. 

#### [Data Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r2PsolJEZtMx6HIJzTZFNOOO5BFDuejNbNi8Xu0Aalg/edit#gid=0) for the full data dictionary -- Our data merges the walkability and airquality index on CBSAs
